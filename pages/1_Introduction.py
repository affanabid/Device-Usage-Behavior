    """
    This project utilizes a rich dataset capturing detailed user behavior metrics from mobile devices. The dataset includes:
    - **App Usage Time (min/day)**: Time spent using applications daily.
    - **Screen On Time (hours/day)**: Total screen-on duration per day.
    - **Battery Drain (mAh/day)**: Battery consumption in milliampere-hours.
    - **Number of Apps Installed**: Total apps installed on the device.
    - **Data Usage (MB/day)**: Daily internet usage in megabytes.
    - Other features such as:
      - **Device Model**: The type of device used.
      - **Operating System**: The OS powering the device.
      - **User Demographics**: Attributes like gender and age group.
